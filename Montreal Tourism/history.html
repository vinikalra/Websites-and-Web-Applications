<h2>Pre-European period</h2>
<ul>
<li>The area known today as Montreal had been inhabited by the Algonquins, Huron, and Iroquois for some 2,000 years, while the oldest known artifact found in Montréal proper is about 2,000 years old.
</li>
<li>
In the earliest oral history, the Algonquins were from the Atlantic coast. Together with other Anicinàpek, they arrived at the "First Stopping Place" (Montréal). There, the Nation found a "turtle-shaped island" marked by miigis (cowrie) shells.
</li>
<li>
The Iroquois or Haudenosaunee were centred from at least 1000 CE in northern New York, but their influence extended into what is now southern Ontario and the Montréal area of modern Quebec.
</li>
<li>
1142 – The Iroquois Confederacy is, from oral tradition, supposed to have been formed in 1142 CE.
</li>
<li>
In the modern Iroquois language, Montréal is called Tiohtià:ke. Other native languages, such as Algonquin, refer to it as Moniang.
</li>
<li>
The St. Lawrence Iroquoians established the village of Hochelaga at the foot of Mount Royal.
</li>       
</ul>
    
    <h2>16th century</h2>
<ul>
<li>
1535 – Jacques Cartier renames the Saint Lawrence River in honour of the Deacon Lawrence on August 10 (Feast day of the Roman martyr). Prior to this, the Saint Lawrence River had been known by other names, including the Hochelaga River and the Canada River. Cartier penetrates far into the interior for the first time, via the river.
</li>
<li>
1535 – September 19, Cartier starts his journey from Quebec City to Montréal, while in search of a passage to Asia.
</li>
<li>
1535 – Cartier visits Hochelaga on October 2, claiming the St. Lawrence Valley for France.[6] He becomes the first European to reach the area now known as Montréal when he enters the village of Hochelega. Cartier estimates the population to be "over a thousand".
</li>
<li>
1535 – October 3, Cartier climbs up the mountain on the Île de Montréal and names it Mont Royal. He wrote: "Nous nommasmes icelle montaigne le mont Royal." (We named the said mountain Mont Royal.) The name Montréal is generally thought to be derived from "Mont Royal", the name given to the mountain by Cartier in 1535.
</li>
<li>
1556 – On his map of Hochelega, Italian geographer Giovanni Battista Ramusio writes "Monte Real" to designate Mont Royal.
</li>
<li>
1580 – The St. Lawrence Iroquoians seem to have vacated the Saint Lawrence River valley sometime prior to 1580.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>17th century</h2>
<ul>
<li>
1601 – On his map, Guillaume Le Vasseur writes Hochelaga for the inhabited area and calls the hill Mont Royal.
</li>
<li>
1603 – Samuel de Champlain comes to the Island of Montreal (Île de Montréal) and Île Perrot. He describes Mont Royal, Lake Saint-Louis and the Lachine Rapids.
</li>
<li>
1608 – Quebec City is founded.
</li>
    </ul>
