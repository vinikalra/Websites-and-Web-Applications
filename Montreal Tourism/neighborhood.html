    <h4><b>Old Montreal</b></h4> 
    <p class="details"> Vieux Montreal, or Old Montreal, is the most touristic neighbourhood of the city, and it is also the oldest. In this historic district, explore eclectic shops and galleries along narrow, cobble-stoned roadways and marvel at the old, beautiful architecture that dates back to the 17th century.
            Today, the city's oldest district, founded as a fur trading post in 1605 by Samuel de Champlain, is a mélange of shops, bars and sidewalk cafes that attracts visitors and locals in equal measure.</p>

    <h4><b>Gay Village</b></h4> 
    <p class="details"> Simply referred to as the Village by locals, this lively neighbourhood was once a poor working-class area, and one of the seedier parts of Montreal. As the city has evolved, the Village has transformed into a vibrant dining, drinking and entertainment district that boasts more than 80 bars, restaurants and nightclubs that cater not only to the city’s LGBT communities but to anyone looking for an alternative night out. Montreal is one of the most gay-friendly cities in the world.</p>

    <h4><b>Quartier des Spectacles</b></h4> 
    <p class="details"> As the name suggests, "spectacles" of one sort or another are the raison d'être of this flashy district between the Old Town and McGill University.
Though the district was conceived in the early 2000s as part of a concerted effort to boost Montreal's cultural life, it's now a bona fide inner city neighborhood that draws locals and visitors alike.
The quarter revolves around the Place des Arts cultural complex, home to the Montreal Opera and Symphony Orchestra as well as the Grands Ballets Canadiens. It's also home to the Montreal Jazz Festival and Just For Laughs comedy fest</p>

    <h4><b>Quartier Latin</b></h4> 
    <p class="details"> West of the Village you can find the Quartier Latin, a small area next to the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) campus. This neighbourhood has an energetic atmosphere and houses a concentration of bars, restaurants, theatres and other hangouts. It may be more active in the wee hours of the night than by day. In contrast, the Quartier Latin is also home to the impressive Grande Bibliothèque du Quebec. The Plateau has a youthful vibe and offers a variety of restaurants, cafes, bars, bakeries and trendy shops that have earned its reputation as the hippest area of Montreal.</p>
